# TaskFlowPro - AI-Powered Task Extraction & Time Tracking Web Application

## Overview
TaskFlowPro is a comprehensive web application that automatically extracts actionable tasks from communications and provides advanced time tracking capabilities with both standard and Pomodoro timers. It combines AI-powered task extraction with project management and gamified time tracking features.

## Key Features
- **AI Task Extraction**: Uses Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 to analyze communication text and extract structured tasks

- **Intelligent Task Organization**: Tasks automatically sorted and displayed according to user's chosen prioritization method
- **Time Tracking**: Standard stopwatch timer and Pomodoro timer (25/5 minute intervals) with project/task association
- **Project Management**: Create, organize, and track time across multiple projects with color coding
- **Gamification**: Children's mode with stars, achievements, and progress tracking for completed Pomodoro sessions
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system using Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations for tasks with priority levels, due dates, assignees, and tags
- **Email Integration**: Send task lists via email with formatted output
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitor task creation, updates, completion history, and timer sessions
- **Real-time Statistics**: Track completion rates, task status distribution, and time spent per project
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Clean, professional interface that works on all devices
- **Elegant Design**: Professional black, white, and gold color scheme for sophistication
