# ðŸš€ TaskFlowPro GitHub Repository Release Guide

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right, then "New repository"
3. Repository name: `taskflowpro` 
4. Description: `AI-powered task management with advanced prioritization methods`
5. Set to Public (for collaboration with co-owner)
6. âœ… Add a README file
7. âœ… Add .gitignore (choose Node.js template)
8. âœ… Choose MIT License
9. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Download Your Project Files

Since we can't directly push from Replit due to Git locks, you'll need to:

1. **Download all files** from your Replit workspace
2. **Extract** to a local folder on your computer
3. **Follow the upload steps** below

## Step 3: Upload to GitHub (Method 1 - Web Interface)

### Quick Upload via GitHub Web:
1. In your new GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop ALL files from your TaskFlowPro project
3. Scroll down and add commit message: `Initial commit: Complete TaskFlowPro application`
4. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 4: Upload to GitHub (Method 2 - Git Commands)

### If you have Git installed locally:
```bash
# Clone your empty repository
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/taskflowpro.git
cd taskflowpro

# Copy all your project files into this folder
# (Replace the generated README.md with ours)

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete TaskFlowPro with prioritization system"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Repository Structure Verification

After upload, your repository should contain:

```
taskflowpro/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Comprehensive project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE                      # MIT license

## Step 6: Add Co-owner as Collaborator

1. In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" tab
2. Click "Collaborators" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add people"
4. Enter your co-owner's GitHub username or email
5. Select "Admin" or "Write" permissions
6. Click "Add [username] to this repository"

## Step 7: Share Repository with Co-owner

Send your co-owner:
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/taskflowpro`
- Setup instructions from the README.md
- Environment variables they'll need (share securely)

## Step 8: Post-Release Setup

### For Development:
1. Both you and co-owner clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Set up environment variables from `.env.example`
4. Run `npm run db:push` for database setup
5. Start development with `npm run dev`

### For Testing Eisenhower Matrix:
1. Create test tasks with different priorities
2. Set prioritization method to "Eisenhower" in Settings
3. Verify tasks are sorted by quadrants:
   - Urgent + Important (Do First)
   - Important + Not Urgent (Schedule)
   - Urgent + Not Important (Delegate)
   - Not Urgent + Not Important (Don't Do)
